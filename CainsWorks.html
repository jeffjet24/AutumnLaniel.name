									<h3 class="major">What is Cains Works?</h3>
									<p>Cains Works is a startup video game company based out of Minneapolis, MN that is currently working on their first game. Their first game is going to be called The Star Rover, and they are hoping to finish a solid demo for the game in the Summer of 2016. In the near future, they will be getting their company webpage set up at www.CainsWorks.com, so stay posted!</p>

									<h3 class="major">What I Do at Cains Works</h3>
									<p>
										As a founding member of Cains Works, I help make major decisions for our first game that we are developing. I have taken on the role of the Media Producer in the Cains Works group. My primary role is to develop media to be used in the game and to market it.
										<br>Some of the things I do as the Media Producer:
										<ul>
											<li>Video Game Trailers in After Effects and Premiere Pro </li>
											<li> Interface Art in Photoshop</li>
											<li>Merchandise Art plus Company and Game Logos</li>
											<li> Social Media and Marketing Assistance</li>
										</ul>
										As Cains Works progresses towards finishing their demo for the game this summer, I will be doing more and more to market the game and make many more videos to create hype for the game.
									</p>

									<p>Below are some of the things that I have created for Cains Works so far!

											<h3 class="major">Cains Works Company Logo</h3>
											<p>
												This is the Cains Works Company logo that is featured on the t-shirts that we have available, and will be used to represent Cains Works as a business. The logo initially started from the splash video that I had developed, and I used Adobe After Effects to create that, and then used Adobe Photoshop to refine the logo into an image.

											<h3 class="major">Cains Works Splash Screen</h3>
											<p>
												I have developed this splash screen as the opening screen in the game to show who the game is created by. I had used Adobe After Effects to create this animation and our audio expert at Cains Works created the audio for the splash video.

											<h3 class="major">The Star Rover Teaser Trailer</h3>
											<p>
												This is the first teaser trailer for The Star Rover, and it is still a work in progress, as it is missing the game name at the end, and the audio for it. I used Adobe After Effects to create this video.

											<h3 class="major">The Star Rover Game Logos</h3>
											<p>
												Above are some of the logos that I have created for The Star Rover game that we are working on and the variations that we have gone through. I had used Adobe Photoshop to create these logos.
