									<p>
										In my entire experience in college, I have consistently performed well in my classes and I am proud to say that I will be graduating with my Bachelor's degree a year earlier then my peers. I took the initiative to take college classes while in high school and strive for the best grades that I could. I have taken as many opportunities as I could to learn more about the skills used in the field while I am in college. Below, you will find details on my experience in college and the significant aspects in that experience.

											<hr>
											<p>
												I first started at Anoka Ramsey Community College because I was a part of the PSEO program, which allows students to take college classes in place of high school classes at no charge while they are in high school. I took classes at Anoka Ramsey part time during my senior year in high school. Since I had done that, I was able to get a year of college completed while in high school. After that, I only needed to spend one more year at Anoka Ramsey to complete my Associates of Arts Degree and be able to transfer to the Univeristy of Minnesota. While I was at Anoka Ramsey, I participated in the Band program and performed well in my classes.
